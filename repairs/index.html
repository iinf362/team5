      <div class="panel-title" id="panel1">What are my basic rights and responsibilities of repair as a tenant?</div>
      <div class="panel-content" id="panelC1"><p>Tenants have a right to live in a property that is "habitable." This means the apartment should be free from danger. Any provision in a lease that waives this right is void, because a landlord must keep apartments in livable condition. However, if the tenant causes a sanitation or safety issue that requires repairs, a landlord is not responsible for the repairs required to make the property livable again.</p></div>

      <div class="panel-title" id="panel2">What sort of damage requires repair?</div>
      <div class="panel-content" id="panelC2"><p>Some areas that must be repaired by the landlord are:
      <ol>
        <li>Plumbing Problems</li>
        <li>Electrical Problems</li>
        <li>Sanitary issues</li>
        <li>Heating and Ventilation systems</li>
        <li>Appliances furnished by the landlord (ie. Refrigerator, Stove)</li>
        <li>Vermin infestation</li>
        <li>Garbage or other offensive materials</li>
        <li>Structural problems to do with any part of the house, including the roof, windows, and floors.</li>
        <li>Landlords must also keep communal areas of the building in repair, the duty of repair does not stop at the threshold of each apartment.</li>
    </ol>
        Local governments may also list additional items that must be maintained by a landlord.</p></div>

      <div class="panel-title" id="panel3">Is the landlord required to repair my apartment, if so, what are my options?</div>
      <div class="panel-content" id="panelC3"><p><b>If I caused the damage:</b> The landlord does not have to fix the property, and the tenant will have to make repairs on his/her own. However, the landlord cannot leave the property in a condition that is unlivable and will have to repair the condition. The landlord may then seek to charge the tenant for the cost of repairs of a condition caused by the tenant.
      
      
      </br>
      <b>If the damage was not my fault:</b> If the damage was not due to your actions, the landlord needs to fix the problem within a reasonable period of time. What that time period is depends on how dangerous the damage is to your health and safety. For example, plumbing problems which stop tenants from using all available bathrooms must be fixed more quickly than a malfunctioning dishwasher. However, based on the lease, a tenant may be able to repair the property and have the landlord pay them back. 
      If your lease includes a section which allows you to make repairs and deduct the cost from your rent, you may be able to get reimbursed for the cost of repairs. A letter asking for reimbursement could look like this:
      </br>
      In order to deduct the cost of repairs from the rent, the tenant must:(a) give notice to the landlord of the existence of the condition; (b) give the landlord a reasonable amount of time to fix the condition (the amount of time that is reasonable will depend on the nature of the condition - a serious condition will require a response from the landlord more quickly); (c) secure repairs that are reasonable in cost and use a professional to make the repairs. The tenant will bear the burden of proving that the costs were reasonable. A good way to do this is to try to get multiple estimates of the costs of the repair in advance of making the repairs so that you can prove that the costs associated with the repair are reasonable.</p></div>
