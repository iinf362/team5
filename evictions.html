      <div class="panel-title" id="panel1">What is an eviction?</div>
      <div class="panel-content" id="panelC1"><p>An eviction is a legal proceeding filed in court that a landlord can use to remove a tenant from a rental property. It commences when the landlord has an authorized individual serve the tenant with the notice of petition and the petition, the court papers that start an eviction lawsuit. A notice of petition is a document that has the time, date, and location of the eviction hearing. The petition notifies the tenant of the landlord's reason for evicting the tenant. The tenant must receive the notice of petition and the petition at least five days before the hearing date, but the hearing date cannot be later than twelve days after the tenant is served.</p></div>

      <div class="panel-title" id="panel2">Can my landlord evict me without going to court?</div>
      <div class="panel-content" id="panelC2"><p>Except in limited circumstances in which individuals have moved into an apartment without the consent of the landlord, the landlord cannot evict you with going to court. After your landlord commences the court proceeding, he or she must win the case and subsequently obtain a court order called a "Warrant of Eviction".

Prior to obtaining a warrant of eviction, it is a violation of the law if your landlord:

Changes the locks
Turns off the utilities (electricity, gas, water)
Padlocks the door to your rental unit
Removes your furniture or other belongings
Prevents you from gaining entry to your house or apartment in any way
If your landlord does any of these things without a warrant of eviction call the police. Illegal eviction is a violation under N.Y. Real Prop. Law ยง 235 (McKinney). If the landlord refuses to let you back into your rental unit, you may want to get a court order telling the landlord how to conduct a proper eviction.</p></div>

      <div class="panel-title" id="panel3">When can I be evicted?</div>
      <div class="panel-content" id="panelC3">If you have a written rental agreement with your landlord, you can only be evicted if:

The lease term expired, or
You owe the landlord overdue rent, or
You have violated the terms of the rental agreement.
It is the landlord's burden to prove in court that any of these are accurate.

If you are a month-to- month tenant and you do not have a written rental agreement, you can be evicted if:

You were given a month's notice to move out, or
You owe the landlord overdue rent.
It is the landlord's burden to prove in court that any of these are accurate.</div>
