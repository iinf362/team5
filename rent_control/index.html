    <h1>Restrictions that Govern the Amount of Rent a Landlord Can Charge and Other Tenant Protections</h1>
    <p>In most cities and towns in New York State, a landlord can charge anything he or she wants to rent an apartment to you. There are some places in New York State that place limits, by law, on what a landlord can charge in certain buildings in those locations. Those restrictions can also impose a duty on the landlord to renew your lease when the term ends. This section helps describe some of those restrictions and where in New York State they can apply.</p>
    <p>Rent control and rent stabilization are the two types of rent regulation in New York State. If an apartment is not covered by one of these regulations, it is considered "unregulated." Some apartments may fall under more than one category.</p>
    <p>This Question-and-Answer Dialogue will help you understand the laws that govern the amount of rent a landlord can charge.</p>

      <div class="panel-title" id="panel1">Are there limits on what a landlord can charge in rent?</div>
      <div class="panel-content" id="panelC1"><p>The first limit on what a landlord can charge in rent is the amount for rent that is stated in the lease agreement between the tenant and the landlord. You should not have to pay more than the lease amount. When the term of the lease ends, in most cities and towns in New York State, the landlord can seek to increase the rent if you want to renew the lease, and you can only renew the lease with the landlordâ€™s consent. There are places in New York State where there are limits on the amount of rent a landlord can charge in certain buildings in those cities and towns. Keep reading for more details on where these restrictions apply.</p></div>

      <div class="panel-title" id="panel2">What is rent control?</div>
      <div class="panel-content" id="panelC2"><p>Rent control limits the rent an owner can charge for an apartment and restricts the right of the owner to evict tenants. The rent control program applies to apartment buildings built before February, 1947, in municipalities that have not declared an end to the postwar rental housing emergency. Several municipalities in New York State still have rent control, including New York City, Albany, Erie, Nassau and Westchester counties.<p></div>

      <div class="panel-title" id="panel3">What is rent stabilization?</div>
      <div class="panel-content" id="panelC3"><p>Generally, in New York City, apartments are under rent stabilization if they are in buildings of six or more units built between February 1, 1947 and December 31, 1973. Tenants in buildings built before February 1, 1947, who moved in after June 30, 1971, are also covered by rent stabilization. A third category of rent stabilized apartments covers buildings with three or more apartments constructed or extensively renovated on or after January 1, 1974 with special tax benefits. Outside New York City, rent stabilized apartments are generally found in buildings with six or more apartments that were built before January 1, 1974, in localities that have adopted the law. Such localities can be found mostly in Nassau, Westchester and Rockland counties</p>
