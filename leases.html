      <div class="panel-content" id="panelC1"><p>A lease is a contract between a landlord and a tenant or tenants that contains the terms and conditions of the rental agreement between them. The terms and conditions in a lease are the rules that the landlord and tenant or tenants agree to follow.</p><p>A lease cannot be changed while it is in effect unless both parties agree to the change. Leases for apartments which are "unregulated" may be oral or written, meaning they can be reached by the parties by oral promise, or the parties can agree to the terms of the lease in writing. To avoid disputes regarding the terms and conditions of the lease agreement, the parties may wish to enter into a written agreement. A party must sign the lease in order to be bound by its terms. While oral leases are permitted in unregulated apartments, an oral agreement to rent an apartment for more than one year is unenforceable.</p></div>
