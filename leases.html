    <h1>Leases</h1>
    &nbsp; When a tenant and landlord agree to rent an apartment or home, that agreement is called a lease. Any agreement to rent out an apartment or home is considered a lease, and the lease does not have to be in writing. A tenant and landlord can simply make an oral agreement to rent out an apartment, and that agreement is called an oral lease. This section describes the basics about leases, and explains how the law interacts with the landlord-tenant relationship as reflected in the lease. Sometimes, the law requires the landlord to provide protections to tenants regardless of the agreement the tenant and landlord reach. In addition, sometimes the law forbids the landlord to impose certain requirements on tenants through the lease: in other words, it prohibits certain lease terms. This section will describe the law governing leases in New York State.

      <div class="panel-title" id="panel1">What is a Lease?</div>
      <div class="panel-content" id="panelC1"><p>A lease is a contract between a landlord and a tenant or tenants that contains the terms and conditions of the rental agreement between them. The terms and conditions in a lease are the rules that the landlord and tenant or tenants agree to follow.</p><p>A lease cannot be changed while it is in effect unless both parties agree to the change. Leases for apartments which are "unregulated" may be oral or written, meaning they can be reached by the parties by oral promise, or the parties can agree to the terms of the lease in writing. To avoid disputes regarding the terms and conditions of the lease agreement, the parties may wish to enter into a written agreement. A party must sign the lease in order to be bound by its terms. While oral leases are permitted in unregulated apartments, an oral agreement to rent an apartment for more than one year is unenforceable.</p></div>
