    <h1>Leases</h1>
    <h2>What is a lease?</h2>
    

    A lease cannot be changed while it is in effect unless both parties agree to the change. Leases for apartments which are "unregulated" may be oral or written, meaning they can be reached by the parties by oral promise, or the parties can agree to the terms of the lease in writing. To avoid disputes regarding the terms and conditions of the lease agreement, the parties may wish to enter into a written agreement. A party must sign the lease in order to be bound by its terms. While oral leases are permitted in unregulated apartments, an oral agreement to rent an apartment for more than one year is unenforceable.

    At a minimum, lease agreements should identify:

    * the apartment or home to be rented;
    * specify the names and addresses of the parties to the agreement;
    * the amount and due dates of the rent;
    * the duration of the rental agreement;
    * the rights and obligations of both parties.

    Except where the law provides otherwise, a landlord may rent on such terms and conditions as are agreed to by the parties. Many landlords will use pre-printed lease forms when reaching a lease agreement with a tenant. If the landlord and tenant agree to make changes to that pre-printed lease, and write in those changes on the lease form, the parties should both write in their initials next to the written change, otherwise that new term will be unenforceable against the party who does not place his or her initials next to the change.

    In New York City, rent stabilized tenants are entitled to receive from their landlords a final, signed copy of their lease within 30 days of the landlord's receipt of the lease signed by the tenant. The beginning and ending dates of the lease must be stated on the lease. Rent stabilized tenants must also be given a rent stabilization lease rider, prepared by HCR, which summarizes their rights under the law and provides specific information on how the rent was calculated.mpus lectus non porta egestas.
